# status-term

The idea of having an application that you can have running on a monitor
somwehere in your home or workplace has always fascinated me. I have used many,
but none have been exactly what im looking for. This is my attempt to create
the perfect solution for myself, and maybe it will be useful to someone else as
well.

The goal of this project is to create a dashboard that is resposive to and
plays nicely with tiled window managers such as i3 or awesome.
